Babysitter Kata

Background
----------
This kata simulates a babysitter working and getting paid for one night.  
The rules are pretty straight forward:

The babysitter 
- starts no earlier than 5:00PM
- leaves no later than 4:00AM
- gets paid $12/hour from start-time to bedtime
- gets paid $8/hour from bedtime to midnight
- gets paid $16/hour from midnight to end of job
- gets paid for full hours (no fractional hours)


Feature:
As a babysitter
In order to get paid for 1 night of work
I want to calculate my nightly charge


Design:
sitter class with attributes
 - start time
 - end time
 - bed time
 - pay rate from 
   + start to bed
   + bed to midnight 
   + midnight to end 
 ? possibly a running total of pay 
and with methods to calculate pay from 
 - start to bed 
 - bed to midnight 
 - midnight to end 
 ? may be one or more functions 
 
 Unaccounted for Edge Cases:
 - pay calculator cannot handle a case when the sitter lets the 
   kids stay up past midnight. to handle this case, one must decide 
   whether to use the post-midnight or post-bedtime pay rate, since 
   they'll both be valid. the problem statment implies that this 
   case doesn't need to be considered. 
 - it is unclear exactly how fractional hours should be handled 
   within the bounds of the evening. are fractional hours invalid input,
   or should they simply be rounded?
   E.g. 
   + sitter arrives at 5pm
   + kids go to bed at 5:30pm
   + sitter leaves at 6pm
   thus, does the sitter get paid for 1 hr of pre-bedtime and 1 hr of post-bedtime? 
   the sitter pay calculator makes this assumption. the pay for this example would be
   1 hr of pre-bedtime + 1 hr of post-bedtime, even though they were only there for 1 hour.
